generations:
  - name: "First Generation (BG)"
    start_year: 1995
    end_year: 1999
    description: "The first-generation Subaru Outback pioneered what would become the crossover segment, essentially created by adding raised suspension, body cladding, and a more rugged appearance to the Legacy wagon. Initially marketed as the 'Legacy Grand Wagon' in Japan and 'Legacy Outback' elsewhere, the model featured 7.3 inches of ground clearance, protective lower body cladding, larger tires, and a more outdoors-oriented image than the standard Legacy. Powered by either a 2.2-liter or 2.5-liter flat-four 'boxer' engine depending on market and model year, with power outputs ranging from 135 to 165 horsepower, the Outback came standard with Subaru's all-wheel drive system paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The interior was largely identical to the Legacy wagon, featuring practical design with reasonable space for passengers and cargo. The model was famously promoted by Australian actor Paul Hogan of 'Crocodile Dundee' fame, establishing the rugged, adventurous image that would define the Outback through subsequent generations. This innovative 'world's first sport utility wagon' approach provided much of the capability and practicality of the increasingly popular SUVs of the era but with better fuel economy, handling, and ride comfort due to its car-based platform—a formula that would eventually be adopted by numerous manufacturers as the crossover segment exploded in popularity."

  - name: "Second Generation (BH)"
    start_year: 2000
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The second-generation Subaru Outback built upon the successful formula established by its predecessor, growing slightly in size and capability while maintaining the core concept of a Legacy wagon with increased ground clearance and rugged styling elements. Now more distinctly positioned as its own model rather than simply a trim level of the Legacy, the Outback featured more aggressive styling differentiation with larger fog lights, more substantial body cladding, and unique interior treatments. Ground clearance increased to 7.9 inches, enhancing off-road capability without significantly compromising on-road handling. Engine options expanded to include a 2.5-liter flat-four as the standard offering in most markets, with the introduction of a more powerful 3.0-liter flat-six (H6) in higher-end models providing 212 horsepower—the first six-cylinder engine in a Subaru passenger vehicle. All-wheel drive remained standard across the lineup, with more advanced systems featuring variable torque distribution on some models. Transmission options included five-speed manual and four-speed automatic, with the H6 exclusively paired with the automatic. The interior saw improvements in material quality, design, and feature content, with available amenities including leather upholstery, premium audio, and enhanced safety features. A sedan version, the Outback SUS (Sport Utility Sedan), was offered in North America, applying the same raised ride height and rugged styling to the Legacy sedan body style. Special editions included the VDC (Vehicle Dynamics Control) model with advanced stability control and the L.L.Bean edition featuring unique styling and premium features. The second-generation Outback further established the model's reputation for offering a compelling blend of all-weather capability, light off-road performance, and car-like driving dynamics in an era when traditional truck-based SUVs dominated the market."

  - name: "Third Generation (BP)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2009
    description: "The third-generation Subaru Outback continued to refine the raised wagon formula while growing in size, capability, and feature content. Styling became more distinctive with pronounced fender flares, a larger grille, and more substantial overall presence, further differentiating the Outback from the Legacy wagon on which it was based. Ground clearance maintained a generous 8.4 inches, supporting the vehicle's 'go-anywhere' positioning. Engine options varied by market but typically included a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated flat-four, a turbocharged version of the same engine in XT models, and a revised 3.0-liter flat-six in higher-end variants, with power outputs ranging from approximately 165 to 250 horsepower. All-wheel drive remained standard across the lineup, now with more sophisticated electronic control systems in some models. Transmission options included five-speed manual, four and five-speed automatic, and the introduction of SI-Drive on some models, allowing drivers to select different engine response profiles. The interior featured improved materials, more sophisticated design, and enhanced technology including available navigation systems, premium audio, and expanded safety features. This generation was the last to be offered in both wagon and sedan body styles in some markets, though the wagon was by far the more popular choice, reinforcing the outdoor, adventure-focused image of the Outback brand. Special editions included the XT Limited with the turbocharged engine and premium features, and in some markets, the Outback 3.0R with the six-cylinder engine and sport-tuned suspension. The third-generation Outback successfully built upon the model's reputation for versatility and capability, finding particular success in regions with challenging weather conditions and among buyers seeking an alternative to traditional SUVs."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (BR)"
    start_year: 2010
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The fourth-generation Subaru Outback represented a significant evolution, growing substantially in size and adopting a more SUV-like appearance while maintaining its wagon body style and car-based platform. In North America, this generation marked the complete separation of the Outback from the Legacy wagon, which was discontinued in that market, with the Outback effectively replacing it. The exterior design featured more upright proportions, increased ground clearance of 8.7 inches, and a taller overall height, creating a more commanding presence. Engine options were streamlined in many markets to focus on a 2.5-liter naturally aspirated flat-four and a 3.6-liter flat-six, with turbocharged options eliminated in most regions. All-wheel drive remained standard across the lineup, paired with either a six-speed manual or Subaru's Lineartronic continuously variable transmission (CVT). The interior grew significantly in all dimensions, particularly rear seat legroom and cargo capacity, with a more conventional design focused on mainstream appeal and practicality. Technology features expanded to include available touchscreen infotainment systems, backup cameras, and enhanced safety features. A key innovation was the introduction of Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance system on higher trim levels, offering adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, and lane departure warning. This generation marked a shift toward positioning the Outback more directly as an alternative to mid-size SUVs rather than as a niche all-wheel drive wagon, particularly in the North American market, a strategy that proved successful as the model achieved record sales. While this approach broadened the model's appeal to family SUV buyers, some enthusiasts lamented the loss of the turbocharged XT variant and the more car-like driving dynamics of previous generations."

    description: "The fifth-generation Subaru Outback refined the formula established by its predecessor, maintaining similar dimensions but featuring more sophisticated styling, improved refinement, and enhanced technology. The exterior design evolved with more fluid lines, updated lighting elements, and a sleeker overall appearance while preserving the model's characteristic raised ride height of 8.7 inches and protective body cladding. Engine options in most markets continued to include a revised 2.5-liter naturally aspirated flat-four and a 3.6-liter flat-six, both paired with Subaru's Lineartronic continuously variable transmission (CVT) and standard symmetrical all-wheel drive. The interior saw significant improvements in material quality, design, and technology integration, featuring a large central touchscreen (up to 7 inches) in the dashboard, improved connectivity options, and enhanced active safety features including Subaru's more advanced EyeSight driver assistance system, which became available across more of the model line. A key focus of this generation was improved refinement, with enhanced sound insulation, more rigid body structure, and revised suspension tuning providing a quieter, more composed ride quality. Capability remained a priority with standard features like X-Mode, which optimized the AWD system, engine output, and braking for challenging conditions. Special editions included the Touring model with premium features like Java Brown leather upholstery and the Outback Wilderness with increased ground clearance, all-terrain tires, and enhanced off-road capability. The fifth-generation Outback continued the model's success as a versatile alternative to traditional SUVs, particularly appealing to outdoor enthusiasts and families seeking all-weather capability combined with car-like driving dynamics and fuel efficiency."
